#IQ 200: Voyager

## Inspiration
We all love to travel but traveling without planning is a direct route to have a nightmare. When it comes to planning, we almost forget about weather conditions at the destination we're planning to reach. Almost all of us must have faced some similar experience at some point. 

## What it does
We've built a simple web application to solve this problem by using weather API to forecast the weather of your destination 10 days from the given input. It then comes up with a recommendation if it's any good to make a trip to that location.

## How we built it
We've used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and weather API. We used the weather API to fetch the location's weather forecast for the next 10 days and display it using frontend CSS & JS frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery.

## Challenges we ran into
Even though this looks pretty simple, this took a lot of our time and work. Our team members including me aren't very familiar with using APIs. So there is a lot of learning that we have to do before getting that API to successfully work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting our head around and using the APIs to serve our needs initially was overwhelming for us, but it became very exciting when we were about to finish the project. This time we put in a little more time in the UI development. So, our project not only gets the job done but also offers a good user experience.

## What we learned
This week we learned a lot about front-end development(UI/UX). We learned how important it is to build applications with a great user experience than just building functional applications with a bad user experience

## What's next for IQ 200 - Voyager
The next step for _IQ 200: Voyager_ is very clear: to modify the aggregated suggestions(probably replace it with some ML script, we don't know yet. Since the present aggregation is implemented using ``` if-else ``` conditions. We're planning to make this static application a more robust and dynamic application.
